# VLSI-Traffic-Light-Controller-FSM-3000-cells-
A Verilog implementation of a 4-way intersection traffic controller using a Finite State Machine. Features parameterized timing, PWM-based light intensity control, and a scalable architecture for multi-intersection systems. Designed for VLSI synthesis with complete RTL, Testbench, and Layout verification reports.
